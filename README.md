   #### Typography
   
   - The Noto Serif from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any

 ### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
  The BMI Calculator website's purpose is to be a tool for finding the weight-height ratio and guiding the users for the measures of what they can do to be within the normal category BMI. On the left box, there is an information of what BMI Calculator is and how BMI is calculated. On the right side box, there are four boxes for the different categories of BMI.

 ### Automated testing
 
- Automated testing is a code used to test the code. It has many advantages over manual testing: hundreds of tests can be done quickly, automated tests are written specifically for the developed project and pick up the mistakes early, can be written for specific case. However, they do not test user experience and are as good as the questions we ask.
- I have decided to use manual testing due to the small scope of the project. 

 ### Deployment

The project was deployed to Github.com using Code institute workspace - gitpod.io
